The party has been transported into a mysterious location that seems to be a prison. 

Upon waking up they are in a stone prison with the cell doors open and their equipment. 

In the center of the prison there will be table with a sealed eveloped. Opening the evelope will 
reveal two papers. A map and a letter welcoming the adventurers to Quenya (if you understand elven you'll know it translates to entrapped).
Stating that it is a small world without hope of an escape. They should meet the high priest in Quenya to 
join the only town and be assigned their roles. The village and a few places of interest are marked on their map 
labeled. 

On the back of the note. It says "ESCAPE MEET OBILISK AT NIGHT".

the societies dedication to generate magical powers and challenge gods. Currently the faith is strong as 
he will drop offerings if needed which is why the people have such a strong faith.
