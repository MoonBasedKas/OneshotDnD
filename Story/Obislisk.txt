A traveler will arrive telling you they've discovered a text detailing how to escape circulating 
within the fort. A wizard has recently arrived in the search of an artifact to cure vampirism. When the 
priests asked the obilisk they were told "UNKNOWN". Since then he's been posted in the Ivory Tower.
This has created a rift between the priests and the nobility. As the nobility wants him to be alive so 
they can discover the outside world but the priests believe of him as a heretic.

The traveler will direct them towards Water Way. Giving a writ of passage to the fort. If they ever need 
to talk to the traveler they will be provided a sending stone. Can communicate with the traveler once a day 
up to 15 words.
