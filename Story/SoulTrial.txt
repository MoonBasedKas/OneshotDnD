- Trail of sacrifice - 
Someone must be brought here and soul must be offered.

Tranlating the slab on the wall (Arcana) will tell the party that this gem must be powered by a soul.

You can describe the tablet/room to kryell and he will tell you that you need to sacrifice a soul.

Ways of obtaining souls:
% You can hire a bard.
% Water way will give a prisoner to sacrifice if you find the hut.
% Soul Jars.
    - If you kill the murderer the gaurds will have one if you ask about needing a soul.
% Killing someone in the room.
    - Can be anyone but hard to convince people without a reason to follow you.
    - Kryell, the king, and the head cleric will refuse to follow
% The traveler.
    - Will be unable to assist later on.

Completing will give a gem
